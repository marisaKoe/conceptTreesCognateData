# conceptTreesCognateData

This program reconstructs distance-based concept trees using cognate data as descirbed in Köllner (2021).
The details of the program are described in Chapter 4.1.2 in the Dissertation.

The cogante data is computed using the algorithm of 

The approach to combine cogante classes and sequence alignment was proposed by Willems et al. (2016).
