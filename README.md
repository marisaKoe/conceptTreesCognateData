# conceptTreesCognateData

This program reconstructs distance-based concept trees using cognate data as descirbed in Köllner, M. Automatic Loanword Identification using Tree Reconciliation, Dissertation, to appear at Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, 2021.
The details of the program are described in Chapter 4.1.2 in the Dissertation.

The cogante data is computed using the algorithm of Rama, Taraka, Johannes Wahle, Pavel Sofroniev, and Gerhard Jäger (2017). “Fast and Unsu- pervised Methods for Multilingual Cognate Clustering”. In: arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.04938

The approach to combine cogante classes and sequence alignment was proposed by 
Willems, Matthieu, Etienne Lord, Louise Laforest, et al. (2016). “Using Hybridization Net- works to Retrace the Evolution of Indo-European Languages”. In: BMC evolutionary biology
