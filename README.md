# conceptTreesCognateData

This program reconstructs distance-based concept trees using cognate data as descirbed in Köllner (2021).
The details of the program are described in Chapter 4.1.2 in the Dissertation.

The cogante data is computed using the Online-PMI algorithm by Rama et al. (2017).

The approach to combine cogante classes and sequence alignment was proposed by Willems et al. (2016).
